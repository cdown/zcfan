.SH NAME
zcfan - zero-configuration fan control daemon for ThinkPads

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zcfan
is a minimal, zero-configuration fan control daemon for ThinkPads.

.SH OPTIONS
.B zcfan
does not take any options. If any are provided, a help message will be printed
and
.B zcfan
will exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION

.SS USAGE

.B zcfan
has the following default fan states:

.RS
.TS
tab(;);
l l l.
Config name;thinkpad_acpi fan level;Default trip temperature (C)
_
max_temp;7;90
med_temp;4;80
low_temp;1;70
.TE
.RE

You can optionally override this configuration at
.I /etc/zcfan.conf
with your desired threshold values in the following format:

.RS
.EX
max_temp 85
med_temp 70
low_temp 55
.EE
.RE

If no trip temperature is reached, the fan will be turned off.

.SS HYSTERESIS

We will only reduce the fan level again once:
.IP "1." 3
The temperature is now at least
.I temp_hysteresis
Celsius below the trip point (default 10C), and
.IP "2." 3
At least 3 seconds have elapsed since the initial trip.
.PP

This avoids unnecessary fluctuations in fan speed.

.SS WATCHDOG

The kernel watchdog is reset every 120 seconds by default, but a
smaller value can be selected in the
.I /etc/zcfan.conf
config file with the syntax

.RS
.EX
watchdog_secs 10
.EE
.RE

.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B thinkpad-acpi
must be loaded with
.IR fan_control=1.
